# Top_100_Repos
In this repo I created REST microservice using Node and Express to get the languages used in top 100 repos on github one month before the current date.

# How to make this repo work 
1- clone this repo into your machine

2- route inside the folder of the project

3- open your terminal

4- write "npm i"    //you should make sure that you have node installed on your machine 

5- write "node server.js"  or "npm run server"

6- using Postman or any similar software send a GIT request using this url "http://localhost:5000/api/repos/getRepos"

7- Now you should have a map with each language as a key and the links to the repos using it as value
